        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          Hi, I’m Diaeddine Brika.  I enjoy staying active and spending time at the gym because it helps me feel strong, focused, 
          and motivated. Working out has taught me discipline and patience, and I like challenging myself to improve little by little.
           Whether it’s lifting weights or trying new exercises, I enjoy pushing my limits and building healthier habits.

        <p>
          Outside of fitness, I’m also interested in learning new skills and improving myself every day.
           I believe consistency is more important than perfection, and I try to apply that mindset both in the gym and in my daily life. 
           My goal is to stay motivated, keep growing, and become the best version of myself through effort and dedication.
        </p>
